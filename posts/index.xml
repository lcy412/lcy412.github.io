      <description>Introduction I made this material as a final review note for QMUL Module EBU4202: Digital Circuit Design. It covers key points and some most difficult parts from Teaching Block1——Block3. Block4 is not included due to time limit.&#xA;Tutorial I hosted and ran the tutorial on June 11, 2024 from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM to help BUPT-QMUL students review the course Digital Circuit Design. The tutorial was for students from two majors, which are Intelligence Science and Technology and Electronic Information Engineering.</description>
