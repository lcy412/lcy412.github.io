# Introduction
I made this material as a final review note for QMUL Module ***EBU4202: Digital Circuit Design***. It covers key points and some most difficult parts from Teaching Block1——Block3. Block4 is not included due to time limit.
# Tutorial
I hosted and ran the tutorial on June 11, 2024 from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM to help BUPT-QMUL students review the course Digital Circuit Design. The tutorial was for students from two majors, which are Intelligence Science and Technology and Electronic Information Engineering.
# Note
Some parts of material are adapted from teaching slides of ***EBU4202: Digital Circuit Design***, especially some screenshots of those slides.
